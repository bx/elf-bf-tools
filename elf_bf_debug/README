BUILD
You will need to build eglibc from scratch in order to use this tool.  setup.sh
should do all the work for you, just go ahead and run it.

building eglibc requies ~800Mb of free space.

RUNNING

run debug_rtld_exec.sh <path to executable> to debug the runtime loader as it
runs that executable.  It also loads a set of tools that can be used to inspect
a Brainfuck stack.  The following commands are available

elfbf set_tape <address>
   -This must always be run.  The last argument is the address of the symbol that holds the address of where the tape pointer is currently pointing.

elfbf print_current_entry
   -prints the current tape entry's value

elfbf print_entry <num>
  -prints entry at tape slot # <num>

elfbf get_tape_index
   -prints the index of the slot on the tape where the tape pointer is currently pointing

elfbf print_tape_range <low> <high>
   -prints the values on the tape from <low> to <high>, not including <high>
