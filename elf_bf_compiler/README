This is the README for the elf_bf_compiler directory.


This directory contains source code for the brainfuck to ELF metadata
compiler. The README in the parent directory contains build instructions.

_Getting Started_
-compile_demo.sh
compile_demo.sh will help you get started with the bf to ELF metadata compiler.
1. Be sure ../demo/demo has been build
2. Create a file containing brainfuck source. We will assume you called it test.bf
3. Run ./compile_demo.sh test.bf
4. Now ./demo contains the crafted metadata to execute the instructions in test.bf

-compile_demo_gdb.sh is the same as compile_demo.sh except it invokes the compiler inside gdb for debugging.

_More advanced BF Compilation_
-elf_bf_compiler
Once you build elf_bf_compiler you will allow you to compile brainfuck source into arbitrary executables.

USAGE:
<path to input executable> <where to write output executable> <path to brainfuck source file> <offset of &end to _dl_auxv>  <where to write debugging information> <tape length>
   ./elf_bf_compiler <path to input executable> <where to write output executable> <path to brainfuck source> <tape length (# symbols)> <optional: [file to write debugger info to] [offset of ifunc that returns 0 from ld.so base]  [offset of _dl_auxv from ld.so base] [offset of &end from _dl_auxv]>
   - the defaults offsets consistently work with our setup, you may need to tweak them to get them working with your libraries.
   - if any offset is provided, all offsets must be provided
   - <offset of &end to _dl_auxv>: &end - _dl_auxv, you can find &end and _dl_auxv by running a binary in gdb using elf_bf_debug/debug_rtld_exec.sh.  Once it starts running, it will break at do-rel.h:117.  At this point you can print &end. If you go up in the call stack 3 times (via the up command), you will be at dl-sysdep.c:244.  At this point you can print _dl_auxv.  Please note that the offset of &end from _dl_auxv may be different when a binary is being run outside of gdb.  If this is a case, metadata that implements branches may cause a segfault and you can inspect the coredump with gdb to get the values of &end and _dl_auxv for binaries running outside gdb.

NOTES:
- if elf_bf_compiler expects its executable will be run in a debugger (if debug config name is specified), it needs to set things up differently (the stack layout differs)
- elf_bf_compiler assumes that your executable uses the same basic set of libraries as demo. There is no way for a user to easily adjust this yet.

FUTURE WORK:
- allow the user to configure the compiler to work with a binary that uses more libraries than ../demo/demo uses
- let the compiler figure out the number of libraries that will be loaded for the executable on the fly so everything works automatically
- (maybe) write debugger scripts that automatically determine the offsets we need
