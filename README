OVERVIEW
This project contains tools that can be used to coarse the gcc's runtime loader
into performing interesting operations using only valid relocation entries and
symbols.

directories:
libelf_bf/ contains files that make up the library
elf_bf_compiler/ implementation for Brainfuck to ELF compiler
elf_bf_debug/ contains useful scripts for debugging the runtime loading process
as it processes relocation entries
ping_backdoor/ contains code that uses relocation entries to build a backdoor
into ping
demo/ contains a simple c program to play with


BUILDING

These instructions are written for Ubuntu 11.10 x86_64. If you are running a
different version of Ubuntu, you should setup a 64bit Oneiric chroot
environment.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebootstrapChroot
for for information.  If you are not running 64-bit Ubuntu, best of luck.
At the very least you will need a amd64 system using eglibc 2.13.


Required apt packages: build-essential, subversion, libssl-dev, cmake

You will need to install eresi from source, which can be found at
http://www.eresi-project.org/
Their code can be checked out using:
$> svn checkout http://svn.eresi-project.org/svn/trunk/ eresi

build eresi as follows;
./configure --prefix /usr/local --enable-64
make
sudo make install install64
(If install fails with "chmod: cannot operate on dangling symlink `/usr/local//lib/libelfsh.so', don't worry. Just move on)

To build elf-bf-tools, in the elf-bf-tools directory
cmake .
make

..and that's it

Thanks for reading, be sure to visit the README files located in
elf_bf_compiler, elf_bf_debug, and ping_backdoor if you end up working with the
code there.
