OVERVIEW
This project contains tools that can be used to coarse the gcc's runtime loader
into performing interesing operations using only valid relocation entires and
symbols.

Slides from our DEFCON 20 talk can be found here:

Slides from our BerlinSides0x3 talk can be found here:

directories:
libelf_bf/ contains files that make up the library
elf_bf_compiler/ implementation for Brainfuck to ELF compiler
elf_bf_debug/ contains useful scripts for debugging the rultime loading process
as it processes relocation entries
ping_backdoor/ contains code that uses relocation entries to build a backdoor
into ping
demo/ contains a simple c program to play with
eresi/ contains a patch for the eresi toolkit



BUILDING

At the moment these instructions are for amd64 machines running
Ubuntu 11.10. I reccomend using the same setup.  If you are running ubuntu, but
not the correct version, you can setup a Ubuntu 11.10 schroot environment.

You will need to install eresi from source, which can be found at
http://www.eresi-project.org/
Their code can be checked out using:
$> svn checkout http://svn.eresi-project.org/svn/trunk/ eresi

Next, apply the patch in eresi/eresi.patch. To do so, change into the eresi source directory and
patch -p0 -i <path to eresi/eresi.patch>

build eresi as follows;
./configure --prefix /usr/local --enable-64
make
sudo make install64

To build elf-bf-tools, in the elf-bf-tools directory
> cmake .
> make

..and that's it

Thank's for reading, be sure to visit the README files located in
elf_bf_compiler, elf_bf_debuf, and ping_backdoor if you endup working with the
code there.
