OVERVIEW
This tool builds a backdoor into ping using only relocation entires to patch the
GOT during runtime loading/linking.  This backdoor will only work with
eglibc-2.13 that is installed by default on Ubuntu 11.10, and the ping from
ubuntu's inetutils.


BUILD
Make sure universe package repositories are enabled.
Run setup.sh, it builds the correct version of ping for you. ping_backdoor
assumes that this script has been sucessfully run/ping was sucessfully built.
ping_backdoor makes a copy of this version of ping, adds relocation entries and
symbols, and writes the new version of ping to the ping_backdoor directory.

To build the backdoored ping, after building ping_backdoor, run
build_backdoor.sh. It looks up the path of libc that ping appears to use and
passes that information to ping_backdoor so that the backdoor gets setup
correctly.

RUN
The backdoored version of ping only is triggered when ping is run with the -t
<type> argument.  The backdoor with stop ping from dropping privledge and will
exec the argument specified with the -t option. If ./ping -t backdoor.sh is
called, ping will drop shell. calling 

> setuidify.sh ping 

will set the suid bit
on ping and make root the owner so that ping can be run by any user.
