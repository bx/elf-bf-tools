OVERVIEW
This tool builds a backdoor into ping using only relocation entires to patch the
GOT during runtime loading/linking.  This backdoor will only work with
eglibc-2.13 that is installed by default on Ubuntu 11.10, and the ping from
ubuntu's inetutils.


BUILD
Run setup.sh, it builds the correct version of ping for you. ping_backdoor
assumes that this script has been sucessfully run/ping was sucessfully built.
ping_backdoor makes a copy of this version of ping, adds relocation entries and
symbols, and writes the new version of ping to the ping_backdoor directory.

To build the backdoored ping, after building ping_backdoor, run
build_backdoor.sh. It looks up the path of libc that ping appears to use and
passes that information to ping_backdoor so that the backdoor gets setup
correctly.

RUN
The backdoored version of ping only is triggered when ping is run with the -t
<type> argument.  The backdoor with stop ping from dropping privledge and will
exec the argument specified with the -t option. If ./ping -t backdoor.sh is
called, ping will drop shell. calling > setuidify.sh ping Will set the suid bit
on ping and make root the owner so that ping can be run by any user.
